        <p>
            An even number of players from four to ten sit alternating around in a circle. Players
            take turns as the "giver", who attempts to prompt their teammates to guess as many
            keywords as possible in the allotted time. However, each card also has "taboo"
            (forbidden) words listed which may not be spoken. Should the giver say one, a "censor"
            on the opposing team hits the buzzer and the giver must move on to the next word. For
            example, the giver might have to get their team to deduce the word "baseball" without
            offering the words "sport", "game", "pastime", "hitter", "pitcher", or "baseball" itself
            as clues. The giver may not say a part of a "taboo" word; for example, using "base"
            in "baseball" is taboo. Nor may they use a form of a word; for example, if the word was
            "wedding" and the taboo words are "marriage", "bride", "groom", "nuptials", or
            "honeymoon", the words "marry" and "bridal" would not be allowed. The giver may only use
            speech to prompt their teammates; gestures, sounds (e.g., barking), or drawings are not
            allowed. Singing is permitted, provided the singer is singing words rather than humming
            or whistling a tune. The giver's hints may rhyme with a taboo word, or be an
            abbreviation of a taboo word.
        </p><p>
            While the giver is prompting the teammates, they may make as many guesses as they want
            with no penalties for wrong guesses. Once the team correctly guesses the word exactly as
            written on the card, the giver moves on to the next word, trying to get as many words as
            possible in the allotted time. When time runs out, play passes to the next adjacent
            player of the other team. The playing team receives one point for correct guesses and
            one penalty point if "taboo" words are spoken.
